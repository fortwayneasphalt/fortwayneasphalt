Natural filtration: When there are floods, the porous pavement will allow the water to go through the sub-base which filters the water and purifies it. Flood water can be filled with bacteria, which is why it’s important that it gets filtered out.
Prevents the heat island effect: Heat islands occur when the pavement installed absorbs the heat. This can cause damage to cars or even injure people if they aren’t wearing the proper footwear. With porous pavements, it doesn’t absorb as much heat.
